bookmarklet-scraper
===================

Bookmarklet-scraper injects a JavaScript file/function of your creation into a live website and displays the result returned in a popup.

A form is provided for creating the bookmarklet link where you can specify the location of your script as well as the location of the other required scripts.

Currently http scripts are not compatible with a https website.
